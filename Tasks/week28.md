Q1. Outline one usability issue associated with the design of mobile devices.

The issues associated with mobile devices can be for example, small low-resolution screens, limited input options (e.g., no mouse or full keyboard), slow computer hardware, and slow or sometimes unreliable connectivity.
One of the most salient usability issues for the mobile Web is the limited screen size. Rather than having to develop a discrete mobile version, researchers have been developing methods to make existing versions more mobile Web-friendly.

Q3. Define the term protocol.
A protocol is a standard set of rules that allow electronic devices to communicate with each other. 
These rules include what type of data, what commands are used to send and receive data,
and how data transfers are confirmed.

**Q4.** Outline the role of the memory data register in the machine execution cycle. 
These pieces of data allow the CPU to quickly 'fetch' and then 'decode' and then 'execute' the instuctions held in RAM
that are part of a program, one instruction at a time.
